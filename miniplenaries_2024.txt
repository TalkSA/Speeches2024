be seated the secretary will read the order debate on vote number 35 science and Innovation appropriation both I now recog The Honorable the minister of science technology and Innovation honorable house chair honorable members Deputy minister of science technology and Innovation honorable members of the portfolio committee acting DG Mr Dano ddgs chairs and CEOs of our entities officials of the department my dear wife Pele and my special guests who are here ladies and gentlemen I'm honored to be delivering the first budget vote of the Department of Science and Innovation under the seventh Administration in the same year that we are celebrating 30 years of our democracy in these 30 years our country has made tremendous strides in science technology and Innovation we ProMag the first white paper in 1996 which emphasize the alignment of science technology and Innovation policy to our goals of democracy we also created new entities with specialized mandates such as the Technology Innovation agent the South African National Space Agency the national Research Foundation and the Academy of Science of South Africa and repositioning other entities such as the csir and the hsrc resulting from these and other interventions by the democratic government our country began to gradually raise the scale of its science technology and Innovation STI as we call it capability is in the period from 1996 to 2024 increasing our share of Global Research output to 0.98% in the third decade of democracy government focused on pivoting the national system of innovation to pursue transformative change in our economy and Society these measures are detailed in the white paper on STI of 2019 and our country's decadal plan of 2022 to 2032 our decadal plan commits to increase science technology and Innovation investment to tackle three societal Grand challenges of climate change and environmental sustainability the future of Education skills and work and the future of society and our Deputy Minister will provide more details on this I now wish to draw your attention to some of the groundbreaking achievements of the DSi during the sixth Administration which have laid a strong foundation for deepening our work in this seventh Administration we have adopted a new vaccine manufacturing strategy which we call vims in short to promote domestic design development and production of vaccines through vims we are targeting vaccine development at the following high priority afflictions the first which we are now going to be able to produce here locally is the rift Val fever which is an emerging transboundary mosquito born disease that causes high morbidity and mortality in both human and ruminant populations the second is the human papilloma virus virus which is a major contributor to cervical cancer in women in South Africa the third is the respiratory synal virus a major cause of respiratory illness and deaths in young infants the fourth is the Hepatitis B virus this is endemic in South Africa with the highest rates in adults and prevalence is five times higher in people who are who infected with HIV in short we are now able to produce these vaccines locally which is a major achievement of the six Administration working with the World Health Organization we have also set up capacity for the local development of mRNA vaccines in response to Future Corona virus threats the DSi budget vote directly responds to the program of action as outlined by the president in his speech during the opening of parliament the hydrogen economy which was specifically referenced by the president is an example of that the DSi is leading Major Innovations to promote the transition to Green hydrogen as an alternative source of energy to fuel our economy and to facilitate Net Zero Energy Future to ensure hold of government coordination and unity of purpose the president created an interministerial committee on hydrogen which is led by the deputy president in March we did the second demonstration of something very important at Kelvin Power Station of a new technology which we call Coal CO2 X to convert carbon emissions into saric is acid a key ingredient in the production of phosphate fertilizers for the agricultural sector this is an example of how we are decarbonizing our economy through carbon capture whilst adding new value and jobs to our economy we also establishing a national solar research facility to promote technology transfer and local ization in support of the renewable energy master plan and the all important cannabis industrialization master plan in the area of AGR processing and farmer development in the 2023 24 period we've provided a total of 1,48 black emerging Farmers with technology development support DSi is also leading scientific and technological advancement in the field of astronomy specifically in support of the construction of the square kilometer array project when completed the ska as we call it will be the biggest ever radio telescope array in the world built here in South Africa costing us $2.2 million us do sorry 2.2 billion US do and offering the world of astronomical Sciences over 50 years transformational science to answer the fundamental question on Cosmic Origins and the evolution of galaxies and black holes building on the successes of the six Administration we remain committed to ensuring the sustainability of existing businesses in the agriculture manufacturing and Mining sectors and supporting the development of new growth industries science technology and Innovation is also about transforming the socio economic conditions of workingclass communities in townships and rural areas in 2023 to 2024 our agricultural bioeconomy Innovation partnership program initiative funded 14 multi- Staker programs multi-stakeholder programs including wheat breeding for climate resilience casava and cotton plant health and oil and protein seeds development trust project we have provided 53 million Rand as an initial investment to support a women Le smme in the hydrogen economy you would recall that in his address in opening Parliament last week the president again explicitly referenced mineral beneficiation in response to this the Mandela mining Precinct is intensifying efforts in minerals beneficiation for further diffusion in the industrial economy over the past 5 years this Precinct has manufactured and tested two drill prototypes through the isingo drill challenge producing a critical mass of young black and women scientists and researchers is one of the critical pillars of our science technology and Innovation strategy in December 2023 the president announced the presidential PhD program this program intends to expose some of our brightest PhD students and post doctoral fellows to the best knowledge and Innovation Frontiers Laboratories Industries and skills development platforms abroad and in Africa this program will be supported through seed funding of 1 billion Rands placed from the national skills fund to be Li varage to 5 billion Rand through private sector and International Development Partnerships as part of building a capable State we've also begun with the establishment of an earth observation data center to provide decision support tools for government in Fire and flood mapping food security monitoring human settlements mapping Forest M mapping disaster management climate change and Water Resources management for instance with the disasters in K and Eastern Cape our National Space Agency is able to produce satellite on details of the exact damage that has been done by these uh inclement weather so that we are able as Government to respond timeously I'm also pleased to say that together with the Department of Tourism we are now also implementing an astro tourism strategy there's no doubt that ska will offer huge economic benefits to local businesses and communities cabinet also approved a science technology and Innovation budget coordination framework to improve cross-governmental budget allocations for STI and enabling Cooperative planning across government for the 2024 2025 Financial year our department experienced a budget cut and was adjusted to 10.5 billion Rand from 10.8 billion in 2023 24 we are also going to deepen our International Partnerships within bricks plus the G20 and UNESCO in order to access more resources as the resources we have are clearly not enough we also look forward to hosting the international astronomical Union general assembly which will be held for the first time on the continent in Cape Town from 6th to the 15th of August it also pleases me to announce that DSi together with other government departments will host an African hydrogen economy conference as a lead up to our hosting of G20 next year in conclusion and in line with our strategic objective of using science diplomacy to Foster human solidarity social justice and in support of our country's foreign policy I wish to formally announce a new program to enable cooperation in science Technology Innovation between South Africa and Palestine the program will also have a special Focus to support for safeguarding rebuilding and developing palestine's research and Innovation capacity and infrastructure and will entail the following joint research projects between South African and Palestinian researchers seed funding of Palestinian Scholars and students in South Africa in exchange programs sharing South African policy experience regarding science policy and system development this new program will be implemented by our entity the national Research Foundation and will be funded from the Department's existing budget for international cooperation one of the serious dangers with the genocide in Palestine is that that that can actually wipe out a whole civilization a whole people and their civilization so we would like to cooperate in the area of science with the Palestinians so that we are able to strengthen our relationship in other words this is a concrete program which is aimed at ensuring that our solidarity with Palestine yes it is with the international court of justice but we must also have concrete programs to work together our challenge is not withstanding we present this budget as our commitment to transform our national system of innovation and using science technology and Innovation to impact the lives of our people in a transformative way thank you very much honorable honorable members the next speaker is the honorable hongu thank you very much uh house chairperson Minister and Deputy minister of the department honorable members good morning the African National Congress established a set of strategic priorities of Science and Innovation aimed at fostering social economic development technological advancement and addressing his historical disparities the 2019 white paper on science technology and Innovation represents one of the guiding policies that has recognized the inqu of transformation within the national system of innovation as a pressing challenge necessi immediate attention South Africa's entrenched history of discrimination has permitted the national system of innovation resulting in a plor of in of inequities and balances requiring R remediation our state fed commitment lies in rectifying these dispares and imbalances within the sector to propel Global advancement through Progressive transformative imperatives honorable house chairperson ensuring continuous funding and steadfast support for women in science technology engineering and maths and for previously disadvantage racial groups particularly blacks researchers within the department of science and Innovation is Paramount the the to achieve this it is essential to implement several key strategies these strategies include the provision of grants for research program for research pro pro projects to facilitate Innovative scientific exploration offering scholarship for Education and Training to empower individual to pursue careers in stem fields and allocating funding for conferences and networking opportunities to Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing furthermore honorable chairperson it is imperative to advocate for a standard percentage of funding specifically designated for women and black researchers additionally there should be prioritization of applications that demonstrate a strong commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion within the scientific Community we applaud the department for its current programs that acknowledge and celebrate the remarkable achievements of women in science through Awards this recognition is crucial in motivating and empowering the next generation of young women in scientific Pursuit ultimately leading to the meaning meaningful and sustainable transformation in the field the Department's plan should include initiatives that focus on women young girls and students from under represented racial groups particularly those with an interest in science and Innovation by implementing these strategies and fostering a supportive and inclusive environment the the department of Science and Innovation can contribute to creating a more diverse and Equitable stem ecosystem that benefits society as a whole we commend the Department's plan to award 1,350 research grants to black women emerging researchers and we trust that this number will increase in the future honorable chairperson the entities within the Departments are fundamental for ensuring the successful realization of implementation plans The Academy of Science of South Africa is dedicated to promoting exceptional achievements across all scientific disciplines as well as acknowledging and honoring Excellence Additionally the academy offers evidence-based scientific counsel to the government and other relevant stakeholders over the foreseeable future the academy aims to Bluster South Africa's ability to generate and disseminate research furnish evidence-based policy guidance to the government and amplify the quality and prominence of research Publications orientating from South Africa these concerted efforts are anticipated to positively impact our economic expansion honorable chairperson it is important to establish strong working relationships with various departments to have a successful impact on the nation's work we appreciate the collaboration between DSi the department of of basic education and provincial education departments as it plays a crucial role in identifying and nurturing young Talent necessary for building a stem human capital pipeline the partnership also contributes to the goals of the DSi lead science engagement program honorable members the department has exhibited unwavering support for addressing pressing societal issues such such as climate change drought and environmental pollution we have witnessed our country's different provinces confront the effects of climate change including the devastating wildfires and destru floods particularly during the current winter season our Collective Mission as a nation is to ensure that this Administration leads our country through many challenges of climate change by implementing strategic scientific measures the department of Science and Innovation must be able to work with all spheres of government and the private sector in col collaborative effort to build resilience and respond to the impact of climate change the government's initiative on hydrogen and energy focuses on driving the the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution the primary goal is to establish a more diverse and sustainable energy mix by facilitating the widespread commercialization of battery fuel cell renewable and Net Zero Technologies these technology Es are rooted in publicly funded intellectual property rights and the government aims to support their penetration in the market through comprehensive research development and validation efforts ultimately the objective is to enhance the Competitive Edge of these Technologies in terms of cost and performance while naturing strateg while naturing strategic Partnerships with both public and private sectors these Partnerships are critical for overcoming in institutional Market barriers thus Paving the way for successful commonization for Energy Solutions we are aware that the feasibility of an interde departmental model for establishing and managing science sectors will be tested over the next 5 years the Albertina suu Science Center inima in Eastern Cape will serve as a test for this initiative Eastern Cape will for this initiative this project involves a partnership between DSi the depart Department of Education in Eastern Cape the department of basic education and in to local municipality as a committee we are committed to providing our attention and oversight to ensure the success of this project honorable house chairperson the state of the nation address characterizes the last five years as a period dedicated to stimulating economy after a decade of stag of stagnation and shielding it from both domestic and global Pils looking ahead to the seven Administration and the 2024 2025 budget our goal is to preserve the gains we've achieved reconstruct our nation and wholeheartedly engage in the ongoing process s Congress honorable members the next speaker is The Honorable man manatu of the MK and it is a maid in speech honorable chairperson um Minister and honorable members um science and technology and Innovation are the cornerstones of the South African economy they are also the dominant forces in modern society and international Economic Development this Department's budget honorable Minister Falls too short of of what we need as a country it Advocates business and as usual and that is unacceptable and we will never support it this country needs a budget that will respond to the demand of science technology and Innovation to impact across critical sectors such as agriculture energy environment Health infrastructure development mining security and water among others regarding health we need to empower and fully support our future Pioneers in human health sufficient funding should go to programs that will enable the next generation of clinician s scientists and Engineers to learn to harness the combined power of science engineering and medicine to translate research finding into clinical practice and to improve human health it's critical that we support our young people and our scientists out there I will support the budget that talks to that we need our scientist to focus on real medicine we need our scientists to focus on medicine that cures this Department supports other departments such as health so it is through this department that other departments can can be stronger now we are talking about vaccines we are talking about other other medic medications if you go to our clinics today the cues are still long and it looks like they will still be longer for quite some time because the budget has been reduced and it looks like there is no intention to do the difference now honorable member just take your seat for a moment honorable members please afford this member the courtesy we afford to members who are giving a maiden speech honorable member please continue chair I think it must remove L is the problem yeah at this point we we're not in the in the business of removing anyone but there's a plea to everyone to to respect the decorum of the house thank you honorable member please continue thank you sh please if they are making noise then there's a problem yeah thank you we've dealt with the matter thank you chair it's critical for us to emphasize the issue of of of medicines because this department is critical to that for me and you to be here today someone survived thousands of years ago they survived mosquitoes they survived all these other ailments the bacterias that we see today they've been there for years how did they survive is there any wisdom that can that we can draw from them that wisdom still exist the HS they use then they still there most of them still have the same properties that can assist us so we would support a budget that will also focus on supporting researchers who would go down to our people to our traditional healers and find out exactly what is it that can be used to cure most of these diseases but today we we take tablets daily we need tablets that will cure us but for us to get there we need to support them with budgets and other measures and collaborate obviously with other countries if you look at China for example they are supporting their traditional medicine so we need to do that and and by the way government should be the founder of these not private funding because someone who benefit from disease will never help us to get out of these problems when it comes to mining technological innovations are particularly relevant in the mining industry which is facing challenges of lower and more difficult to access great deposits they are facing environmental Footprints concerns health hazards and depleting access to resources such as water and energy needed for mining operations Innovation plays a critical role in the mining industry as a tool to improve the efficiency of its processes to reduce costs but also to meet the increasing social and environmental concerns among communities and authorities technological progress has also been crucial to allow the exploitation of new deposits in more complex scenarios lower or grates extreme weather conditions deeper deposits harder Rock mass and high stress environments South Africa needs a progressive budget meet some of these challenges in the mining sector regarding entrepreneurship we need to focus on entrepreneurship ship but not just spor shops we need to focus on Tech entrepreneurship for South Africa to radically create jobs and economic opportunities we need to support our Tech entrepreneurs we need to we need a National Science and Technology entrepreneurship development strategy small Enterprises are considered as engines of economic development in developing countries including South Africa we need a budget that will enable us to develop science technology and ENT and entrepreneurships parks in our townships and rural areas with the objective of creating knowledge based entrepreneurs among others it is critical to develop a radical institutional mechanism to help promote knowledge driven and Technology intensive Enterprises MK believes that this initiative will convert job Seekers into job generators through Science and Tech technology uh interventions um in 20 2013 the 1st of November uh our president Jacob Zuma called on more youth to take up mathematics and science saying the country will need will be guaranteed an economically bright future we need to to support our our young minds in education we need to repurpose some of the closed schools and closed teacher institutions for them to focus in science technology and Innovation we need also to build up the drums to make sure that the public at large understand the importance of this department it is critical that we we get a Buy in from everyone during World Cup everyone was supporting World Cup soccer even those who never played football we can do the same also for science technology and innovation it's very critical for this country to do that in agriculture we need to support our researchers so that they can help us to get seeds that are good for us not the suicide seeds that we are now subjected to we were never consulted when they gave us this when they came up with the suicide seeds hon M that can grow honorable member you plant the seed grow your time is now expired thank you thank you honorable members before I announce the next speaker I've been requested to just alert members uh to try and not speak too closely to the mic it would seem a distorts sound when we do the broadcast to the public the next speaker is The Honorable Matson mat house chairperson horn Minister zandi fellow members of parliament science technology and Innovation are now commonly accepted to be the cornerstones of the majority of the world's economy they are dominant forces both in modern society and in the international Economic Development sphere if this area is strengthened the way it should be the results will encourage an open transparent system of government throughout the world in fact so important is this field that the African Union Science and Technology Innovation strategy for Africa 2024 named on the wings of innovation places science technology and Innovation at the epicenter of Africa's socioeconomic development and growth human capital is absolutely essential to the development of a national system of innovation that is globally competitive and responsive to the South African developmental needs this department must ensure that it provides support through the granting of bseries scholarships sponsoring internships and funding emerging and established researchers South Africa is a nation of great innovators from our world famous creepy cley Pool Cleaner prattle PTY which just for your information is the only South African substance on the moon to being the advanced surgical country that we are including being the country to conduct the first successful human transplant to the country emerging as a leader in solar power and renewable energy Innovation Technologies such as artificial intelligence robotics big data analytics and Quantum Computing now have the potential to completely change how we operate the economy and South Africa's research and innovation in these fields that could play an instrumental role in the growth of our Nations we must prepare ourselves and our workplaces for the fundamental changes and challenges these technologies will bring them Minister we must never find ourselves blindsided by a further lack of employment due to a lack of knowledge as to how technology operates and how best to use it to our abilities and to improve our Workforce we must be acutely aware of the possible misuse of emerging Technologies now while AI has the ability to change and improve the way we work we must also ensure that there are regulations in place to ensure that there is not an abuse of these technologies that AC mic progress is not compromised due to such abuse children must still enjoy a comprehensive comprehensive education and we must never become dependent on AI to take over the human mind and the capacity for understanding Innovation creation imagination and most importantly cultural knowledge Innovation results in productivity growth that brings ba vast benefits to that large entirety of our country as productivity Rises so will wages and businesses will become more profitable this will enable them to invest more and to hire more employees the full benefit of innovation can be re realized and it will be necessary to spread it across the economy to equally benefit companies in different sectors and different sizes experts call this process diffusion of innovation these are various measures to promote innovation including increasing spending on research and development known as R&D and investing in education as well as enabling startup businesses companies can facilitate Innovation by investing in their staff and conducting their own R&D it is said that if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish you'll feed him for a lifetime that's how the saying goes we must not be afraid to encourage the sharing of information and knowledge by encouraging more entrepreneurship programs encouraging our young people to learn skills that they can develop over time no matter how advanced technology becomes the world will always require Artisans and artisanal skills are becoming increasingly rare we now admire work done by Artisans and we need minister to find that balance between large scale production and artisanal Excellence there are some things that you can only learn on the job young people should be excited about these opportunities and certainly when it comes to small and medium Enterprises this is a sure way to grow entities and promote growth and profitability Minister never before have the prospects been greater the potential more accessible and the need for the Urgent advancement in the field of science technology and Innovation greater we are we are a country of vast resources and great creativity and of this I'm extremely proud let us work together to advance this field to grow our economy and most importantly to people I thank you well honorable member please just take your seat for a moment oh were you done why are you Rising no thank you I just wanted to find out if the speaker on the podium can take a question whether she has now completed her degree on law or no honorable member you know the rules very well you first inquire whether the member is prepared to take a question and then you pose the question honorable M matone uh are you prepared to take a question absolutely thank you house shair C horn h mwe will you now phes your question um honor Ma just want to check if you have now completed your law degree as it initially you said you had but it turned out that actually hadn't so I thank you honorable member understand now if you have now actually gone to school and you now have a law degree honorable member in the year 1996 I matriculated from The Glenn High School I have not completed a law degree neither have I ever said that I've completed a law degree I am however now in my fourth term of Parliament and please believe me when I tell you I am a master in manners and you would do very well to learn a little bit from me thank you so much for the question thank thank you The Honorable order honorable members honorable buo please just take your seat for a moment order honorable member to the to my right why are you Rising no thank you very much I was just saying that the member on the podium must wait for you to call in I think it's too to forward yes let him go back and then you'll call him thank you this time we we we'll not ask that but yes please honorable members uh please just wait until you are called upon to speak before you enter the to the podium but we will not ask this member to go back order order honorable members let's listen to one another I'm sure the honorable Pomo is also uh going to uh add to this debate honorable PBO please take the podium no thank you very much uh thank you very much chair person let me Begin by saying that I'm inspired by the spirit of sendas and that I'm not going to be asked to be called to the podium I'm going to come to the podium unannounced Uninvited unwanted and I'm going to take it by the HS so cherson allow me to address the house and but also let me tell honorable mazone mazani that um it is very bad that you may come to this house and say that you want to represent the people of South Africa and that you don't take time to engage in personal development and yet to take the time to come and speak about science and technology and Innovation but you do nothing to develop yourself it is in the essence of what whiteness White Privilege has given you none of us sitting here have not taken time listen to me the point P please just take your seat honorable member CH sh the member at the podium is casting experss on my member I don't think it's permitted what what is The aspersion Honorable ler he's suggesting that she she requires personal development I think that's a personal attack now thank you honorable pumber just take your seat one moment more order order chair person chair person that's the matter of opinion honorable member you've not been recognized I I'm helping you no no I'm not needing your assistance at this is in a crisis or thank you please switch off your mic um honorable members if you'll give me a moment I can deal with the matter honorable members uh I've not heard the honorable pumo uh casting an aspersion to the effect that there is a an attack on the integrity of The Honorable Matson what I heard as as him reacting advising that she must invest like all of us in our personal development uh that being said of course it there is no requirement in law for any of us to hold a degree so let's respect one another honorable pumu please continue with the merits of this bite no thank you very much CH person uh members of The National assembly let me greet the commander and chief the president of Africa um and the treasurer General was here was weeping the progressive uh organization called the EF let me also greet the members of MK and other members of the progressive caucus honorable chair person members of the National Assembly science Innovation and Technology Are Not Mere academic Pursuits as an illiterate speaking when I'm speaking they are the very life blood of our exist of our existence and progress they are Central to our ability to drink clean water farm and produce food have dignified sanitation improve the quality of education and fight poverty inequality and unemployment without science there is no way forward we cannot achieve reindustrialization Iz ation create new Industries build new cities or develop our society this is the centrality of science Innovation and technology and understanding that the former Liberation movement even with 30 years of experience in government failed to appreciate this fully now we find ourselves facing the same lack of comprehension in the so-called government of national Unity led by the illiterate Democratic Alliance on behalf of the openers and the rets despite the ample opportunities afforded by the Parliamentary meries and white privilege they failed to grasp the complexity and significance of organized knowledge countries that take themselves seriously invest an average of nearly 3% of their p in research and development Minister meanwhile here in South Africa we languish at 0.6% contribution in our GDP this is the mediocrity we are dealing with the Preble of the 1996 white paper on science and technology in baged and promised a future where all South Africans would enjoy an improved and sustainable quality of life participate in a competitive economy by means of satisfying employment and share in a democratic culture 30 years later the people of South Africa are being misled and lied to yet again their quality of life being misled and lied to yet again has not improved the economy has failed to create jobs and provide satisfying employment and the Democratic culture continues to benefit the privileged minority to the exclusion of the oppressed and impoverished majority Minister you would know that no economy in the world can drive Social Development and economic growth with the aim of creating jobs without positioning science technology and Innovation as the key drivers of economic activity and prosperity to turn around our our stagnant and jobless economy we must urgently address the stubborn challenges of knowledge production and pursue targeted research and development under this government South Africa no longer has a competitive Advantage we keep being asked to vote for a budget yet we keep falling lower and lower in the global competitive index and the global in Ovation index we have continuously failed to meet our own targets for gross expenditure on research and development as a percentage of South Africa's gross domestic product which are themselves significantly lower than Global standards without playing a significant role in actively supporting uh the research and development the government will never be able to signif to meaningfully contrib rute to the advancement of productivity and opening new channels of economic activity this indecisiveness from the government has also led to a decline in the aggregate levels of gross private sector investment in the R&D honorable pumber unfortunately your time has now expired no no thank you very much chairperson but you must say that we reject this budget which has unfortunately failed but also to say that need an increase in the budget this pleas V the standard of our business thank you very much the next speaker is be honorable zandu order please allow The Honorable zand to take part in this debate honorable zand please continue the STI derived its mandate from 1996 white paper on science and technology which introduced the concept of national systems of innovation a set of inter interaction organizations and policies through which South Africa create acquire diffuse and put in in practice new knowledge to help achieve individual and Collective goals as an ifp we acknowledge the importance of science technology and Innovation as a critical component to create much needed job opportunities and position ing our country as an economic leader in southern Africa and Africa this committee must ensure that the department deligently execute its responsibilities relating to this component and maximizes their potential to accelerate economic transformation and improve our country's competitiveness the ifp believe that adequate Research into the potential of Natural Resources local labor capacity and how we can integrate the use of capital resources to boost effort in job creation can bring about the change in our country needs the this the department needs to cons reflect on its Target particularly regarding program two Technology Innovation program four research development and support and program five social economic Innovation these programs take priorities because they are time sensitive and fundamentally to development the budget cut rating to this department are concerning because without the necessary funding the threat of failure to lead the economic development agenda as a mandate by it citizen looming over us however the IP believed that that if limited funds are prioritized they should be focused on localized research and development programs in our country there's a need of Science and inovation to play more active role in developing our national and Global e emergency protocols where factual information is a key to drive a decision making by by government with developing of this for Industrial Revolution and all its various tools information is readily available but not accessible at all what is needed is more complete complete strategy that dives in the details of vision of the socio economic needs of our country the required support infrastructure across the Spectrum as a well proper emergency response mechanism unfortunately the department of science Innovation will experience a signant budget cut of 3 billion over the course of the next three years in an an effort to re re it public expending while understanding that this previous administration public spending has gotten completely out of control due to the mismanagement and misappropriate of f propriation of fund we can we cannot ratify this by pushing the very sou African seeking to make the difference an example of this is the fact that the national Research Foundation plans to fund 1,000 fewer researchers in 2024 2025 which is is 25% drop from 2023 to 202 due to the significant budget cut by the DSi while nothing can be done about in spending 3 billion budget cut the IP ures the department and the new government to ensure that the advancements of research and Innovation remains a top priority especially it related to adequate addressing our country social economic challenges furthermore we are clear witnessing the tragic under representation of skills and capable women in the science technology and field women who come from a previous disadvantage background need to be supported at a postgraduate postgraduate level so that they can May that that they may contribute and Inspire more women in the field moreover while some grounds has been made there's still a large gap when it comes to F graduates in science who are employed in the private sector they paid consed less than their male counterpart and under represented in all Industries therefore Minister the I's Department to consider this issue when find to cover the Fallout ofon cut as an ifp we support v v 35 with the view that the Gap created by the budget uh cut implemented in National Treasure can be mitigated by corporating efforts with other dep I thank you honorable members point of order chair person yes why are you Rising honorable member I wanted to check with the speaker no no hon no honorable member thank you you you can take that offline thank you the next uh honorable B I see you on the podium but uh the PA is uh allowed to uh was indicated that they wanted to take part in this debate let me just firstly inquire is there a speaker on behalf of the PA not then we move on honorable BOS honorable bosov please just take your seat yes honorable member why are you Rising no thank you very much chair my hand was getting tight chair you have called order on honorable for speaking without you um notice um giving him a space to do so he continues so can you please call order and warn him so that he must not stop he must stop doing it because if you don't he will continue to do so thank you honorable member um I'm sure he'll take your his his guidance from you now honorable member let let's please continue honorable bosov please let's let's respect the theorum of the house or honorable members yeah let's work with one another science and Innovation is an important topic honorable bosov it's your chance to debate thank you honorable chair honorable Minister and fellow colleagues in the department or well of the Department of Science and Innovation and colleagues within the committee I think in the center of science Innovation and technology which is a new name of the department is actually Innovation that is what everything pivots around inov a is a new way of uh thinking a fresh way of approaching problems a new way of doing stuff according to the challenges that confronts one now that is actually not something that you can teach somebody you can lead somebody to develop honorable BOS my apologies please just take your seat I see a hand there at the back honorable chair I'm just checking to the presenter that is parliamentary to not uh tag in his chat H I'm just checking no honorable member that's not as that's not helpful let's let's all respect one another let's afford this member his opportunity to debate please continue I thought maybe the member has a problem with me speaking English today um yeah I I know it doesn't sound like English but I try um within this department of science Innovation and uh technology it is important really to instill a way of thinking which of course is based on knowledge on science and which uh con converts into technology which is of practical use economical use and that is something that one actually needs a kind of a spirit you could say a national Spirit of innovation which is uh by the way something which is not always really instilled by the formal educational sector sometimes you find that the most Innovative people are those who were not formally schooled in some or other direction because they have this uh Innovative view of life as I always say in Africans now uh I think one G one finds two kinds of departments within the state uh setup there are consumption departments those that use up money and then there are investment departments those that uh uh generates money or development within time and Science and innovation technology is definitely one of the second part but there's another distinction between departments you get some departments in which you see an immediate problem if you you neglect it if you neglect education it's immediately visible if you but if you neglect science and Innovation it's not so soon to be seen and that is a problem that's why the people the number crunches tend to spend more or to allocate less money to science and Innovation and that is a problem because it means the negative results are going to be visible within 10 or 15 or 20 years and maybe not with something that we see but with all the possible things that we don't see the things which don't happen because the Innovative thinking and the science-based knowledge was not uh applied in the correct way now the problem is to see to say how does one fund or increase funding in a department which doesn't uh generate money immediately within a stagnant economy and maybe it could be a plan to say but let us fund the satas and the skills develop uh the skills fund from a parliamentary Grant and take this 1% skills development Levy and make it rather science and Innovation Levy that would increase this Department's funding from about 10 billion to some 18 or 19 billion Rand per year uh and it could be growing and then I should uh not end this speech without saying that the land of the ska is not fenced yet and it's still very difficult to form within near their ruat breeding grounds thank you honorable chair thank you the next speaker is The Honorable L thank you to the chair the minister the deputy Minister the chair of the committee and the DG just want us to remember I'll give five seconds for a moment for all the victims of Science and Technology from Hiroshima and Nagasaki to project Coast to the carpet bombing in the Middle East you understand that research and development can also lead to human destruction I hope Minister you'll be able to get funds H will you please take just take your seat for a moment there's a hand here in front honorable member why Rising um chair I just want to find out why there is only an inter Africans interpretation here The Interpreter is Africans only wine honorable member um when I checked right at the start of the debate there was some other translations available uh my advice would be to maybe just move through the different channels last week when we had multiple um mini plenaries we of course were able able to only uh translate into English from other languages but today when I checked there was other languages apart from afri cons thank you yes no not not on this room it's only AF Africans yeah I'll I'll ask that the uh secretari assist to just verify um but Honorable in the meantime please continue research and development Minister that can help us as South Africans how to move from Talking Summits and commissions to action we talked too much we passed too many laws but our country is deteriorating what has gone wrong with us Research into making beneficiation a reality in this country so that we stop complaining and stop talking about it and still export raw materials and we do not grow as an economy I just want to ensure minister that we'd be able to do science and research to strengthen small businesses I had the minister talk about can cannabis industrialization we have had our parents and grandmothers deal with dhha for ages are they now going to be displaced by billionaires is there going to be research to assist them so that they become viable viable economies I just like to remind people that if you create one billionaire you could have created a thousand millionaires an object poverty is inversely proportional to billionaires in your society as we see the number of billionaires increase children star in the Eastern C and we need to be mindful of those issues just knowing what you are eating there's no research on the things that matter we then talk about obesity as an end trade when people are not even informed as to the foil they put into their mouth the impact it'll have on their on their health can we have research on those issues can we have socioeconomic impact studies on all the issues that come up and look look at the potential hars to society from these issues from where I come from in the medical world we know the harmful effects of D but everybody is talking about industrialization I need to remind people that in America they have an oped pandemic because of people trying to relieve pain and everybody going out there now they have suicides we have high mental health illness in this country so as we industrialize on these issues can there be funding for properly conducted randomized clinical trials that can inform the alleged health benefits of cannabis so that when we incorporate it in health it is based on solid evidence so that when you talk to your patients about it you are basing it on science you are basing it on clinical trials minister all I ask is that it cannot be business as usual let us look for funding that will help improve what happens in our societies we support the budget because research is important and we hope that a percentage of GDP will be devoted to research your time has now expired thank you honorable members the next next speaker is The Honorable the deputy minister of science technology and Innovation thank you very much h house chairperson good morning honorable members Minister honorable acting General director and all the ddgs chairperson H CEOs of all the enti ities that are here ladies and gentlemen H we stand here being encouraged by the strides that this department has taken and has made over the previous terms of a Administration and building the national system of innovation our inclusive science system accommodates all Races and genders and science is driven by the need for a better life one which generate knowledge to drive the economy across several areas as part of this gender commitment we'll be intentional about women in science technology and innovation in this regard honorable chair allow me to recognize a special guest that we have in this house today by the name of Sen masango s is a nuclear scientist an alumini of a European organization of nuclear research called sen a nonexecutive board director at a South African nuclear Corporation Called Nexa she empowers women women in engineering and science field she's a young black South African woman s you can stand up thank you very much sen these are such women that we are saying we need to make sure that they multiply and we see quite a number of them chers as a country we must seek to avoid what Isaac Asimov a professor of biochemistry in Boston University once said about science and Society he said I quote the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than Society G gathers wisdom close quat I must I may as well add that Innovation and groundbreaking disruptions are moving faster than Society gathers wisdom it is our responsibility as this department that as we drive the imperative of science technology and advancement advancement and Innovation that Society is not left behind but proceed in tandem science technology and Innovation must never be understood as for the specialized Elite divorced from society that it finds itself CH person it is our biggest aim our biggest aim is to strengthen actions targeting critical structures opportunities and challenges facing South African society that require data research through leadership and policy experimentation opportunities and challenges include persistently high levels of poverty and unemployment the fact that our community and our society remains one of the most unequal in the world governance challenges a maturing democracy demographic shifts including young dividend higher levels of crime including unacceptable high levels of gender-based violence the above will be achieved through the establishment of national research research institutes by investing on STI the department is focusing on enabling all stakeholders in our society to participate in ensuring that South Africa leads in its Mandate of creating science for good of society to respond to key societal challenges especially the climate change honorable members over the two past decades a number of successful initiatives were put in place to facilitate the use of available science for policy in action get together with the presidential climate change commission we finalized the part the development of medium-term climate change research and development road map in the face of Rapid technological change as well as other drivers Human Society is undergoing fundamental and accelerated change such change is particularly significant in educational system both basic and post school as well as in workplaces in the current Financial year DSi in partnership with human resource Development Council Secretariat will finalize the scoping of a well-designed Observatory and and mobilized key users and role players and in respond to covid-19 uh pandemic an Institute of pandemic preparedness and response is now at an advanced age of development honorable members the research plays a pivotal role in our society and to date 276 research chairs have been awarded to universities and other research instit institutions have supported supported 16 centers of excellence in addition to the above the department has introduced 16 National Institutes for research design and Innovation to consolidate and enhance the RDI capacities emerging from the above centers of excellence research chairs and other initiatives supported by government the nrd for forged close links with business and industry to improve interfaces between research and economic production cherson consistent with our aims of mainstreaming science to society as part of our decadal objectives it is important to drive the Divide between science and Society through make taking science to the people connected to the above societal commit commitment the department has conducted South African public relationship with science survey which is a study to gaug science literacy in South Africa the survey report will be officially launched and released to the public in few year in few months and will inform future programs key to our DEC decadal goals it is human capital development and training of which most of the H honorable members have talked to working with Higher Education and Training Department in catalyzing noled driven economy we have funded post-graduate students of which our um Minister have spoken to to date we have supported 12,000 PhD student at the same time supported 24,400 Hors and master students by this number we have met a Target that that have set that we have set for 2019 to 2024 period as a Fed commitment to funding Innovation Minister andand announced a higher education Innovation fund of 30 million targeted at student mainly youth at Tate colleges and universities this will support Innovation and Tech ENT entrepreneurship at these institutions honorable members in this seventh Administration there's going to be a particular focus on skills development in various sectors that are strategic for DSI the development of skills will be prioritized in the Cal in the catalytic Innovation area such as energy sector for example skills needed to for the implementation of hydrogen sector road map and the development of renewable energy sources of which we know there are challenges in our in our uh country these skills development in the health sector will be notable be in the vacine manufacturing initiatives which include supporting the country's RDI Capac Capac cap abilities to manufacture vaccines honorable man you spoke very well on this and exactly that is our Focus as the department as we undergo this exactly we couple that with the indigenous knowledge as you correctly put on and pointed at at that is exactly what we are focusing at this as this department and as the member of the committee we are going to work the journey with you and see how we focus on those the department is finalizing the establishment of the municipal Innovation fund to allow municipalities to apply for the funding to implement technology and Innovation projects identified by them to meet their requirements in addition the DSi has piloted the technology the technology acquisition and Development Fund that aims to achieve the inclusive development strengthening the procurement to use locally developed Technologies by various departments and in the municipality to date the above program where we deal with the research and H the development when it comes to the tax incentives H used by by by by by the I'm trying to summarize used by businesses the business support to date we have processed more than 3,000 application by those business support fund that we have created and we are working with our businesses to make sure that when it comes to the test incentives we support the the business sector so that our smm we boost them honorable Deputy Minister that F unfortunately Your Time Is Now expired we are looking forward to work with this portfolio committee to make sure that we touch the lives of our people every day thank you very much honorable chairperson the next speaker is the honorable string honorable house chairperson the acdp is cognizant of the budget cuts across most government departments due to fiscal constraints caused by over borrowing of more than five trillion Rand budget deficit it of over 300 billion Rand corruption and failure to implement the necessary structural reforms to revive our economy the department of Science and innovation has not been spared the wanting excesses of pre of the previous government the national Research Foundation uh South Africa's Chief science funer with a mandate to fund research develop human resources and enable knowledge creation Innovation and development in all fields of Science and Technology will now award um 1,000 fewer grants in 2024 than last year thanks to budget cuts this equates to 1,000 less exceptionally Bright Young scientists denied the opportunity of further study and perhaps discovering life-saving interventions in the view of the acdp budget cuts over the past 5 years have been the plague on Sou Africa's Department of Science and Innovation this is corroborated by the PC chair honorable qua who lamented if we had stability of funding we would be able to do so much more the acdp agrees with the committee in that government should collaborate with the private sector to raise the level of research and development additionally it is essential that public investments in research infrastructure be focused on to fulfill the needs of a modern economy the acdp supports the six science technology and Innovation priorities um which are in modernizing manufacturing Agriculture and Mining pursuing new sources of growth within the digital and circular economies health research and Innovation Energy Research and Innovation um and Innovation to enable a capable State as well as innovation in support of social economic progress finally house chairperson as a former maths and science teacher myself there must be a recognition that the journey to a healthy science and Innovation environment must begin at Grassroots level at primary and high school levels and it must include the further education reskilling and upskilling of our Educators so as to instill a love for Math and Science robotics coding and it development in the formative minds of our Learners thank you thank you honorable member is there somebody representing the udm rise Bosa the NCC then I call to the podium next The Honorable ramono honorable members please note it's a ma in speech uh thank you house chairperson uh greetings to the minister and the deputy Minister and honorable members yet today it's sorry it's an honor and a privilege to partic participate in a debate of such groundbreaking Department that is expected to be a catalyst in the fast changing world of science technology and Innovation this department has a massive potential to put a dent in the high unemployment rate in the country especially among young people but we have to get the basics right we need to get the country going South Africa is being left behind in the tech technologically advanced world that needs a population that is technos saity there needs to be more guidance and deliberate effort at a lower level for students to take up subjects that will equip them for Science and Technology as we have in the Department's 2019 2014 Apex priorities Apex priority 3 education skills and health the intervention seems to be happening much later at test institutions which results in fewer young people who get empowered by the department on the other hand we have many students with access to technology tools like cell phones that can't be used to close this Gap according to statistics from Common Sense Media 42% of kids have a phone by the age of 10 by age 12 it's 71% and by 14 it's 91% instead of discouraging the use of cell phones at schools I think it's time we put them to good use this is a tool that can help Young people to pursue a career and not just be social media influencers Bill Gates of Microsoft Steve Jobs of Apple iPhone Mark zaker of Facebook Sean Carter popularly known as Jay-Z in the music industry they are all billionaires who used technology to pursue their careers we now need to create a condusive space for young people like Kyle from kyisha honorable member just take your seat for a moment h honorable members it today it it would seem it as if when we announce there's a maiden speech it is exactly the the effect we don't want please afford this member the courtesy we afford members who are delivering a maiden speech thank you I depend on your support honorable member please continue honorable member relax I'm getting to that now we need to create a conducive space for young people like KY in Mitch from a from K from G so that they too can enter into the tech space and create General generational worth for themselves and their families according to the Department of basic education out of 700,000 full-time matriculant who wrot exams only 200,000 wrote met only 16% achieved 60% or more this is very concerning and cast some serious doubt on whether the department will be able to achieve its vision and a code to increase wellbeing and prosperity through science technology and Innovation ours as a country of contradictions we have the highest unemployment rate in the world especially among young people yet the highest demands is in jobs that require science Mathematics and Technology skills in March last year africa.com stated that nationally only 20 2% of households have computers while only 10% have an internet connection in the Northwest and limoo provinces only 3.6% and 1.6% respectively have access to the internet at home in 2018 the National Education infrastructure management system found that only 4,605 out of 23,41 of schools had Internet connect connectivity for teaching and learning honorable Minister that needs to stop today there are many good initiatives that are already contributing to the Department's strategic goals bandwith B in kicha is one of the great examples of empowerment while boosting the township economy one of its initiatives is a smart Tech program for informal traders that uses smartphones to increase process efficiency so far it has supported more than 3,000 Township based entrepreneurs and trained 500 informal traders in smart technology climate change and electricity challenges have presented a massive opportunity for Innovation using technology the City of Cape Town has committed over 2.3 billion in the next three years to end load shedding and 1.2 billion to a solar PV and battery storage project while the Western Cape government has set aside 11 16.6 million for energy for its energy project scheduled to launch or continue in the 2024 2025 fiscal year this is creating new opportunities in the renewable energy space to also solve the unemployment crisis it can be done if we pull together under one common goal thank you thank you honorable member I will now call honorable El Mutu thank you thank you very much uh honorable chairperson Minister Dr blande um honorable members of the committee on behalf of the ANC I wish to support budget vote 35 as presented by the minister we affirm this budget conscious of the still persistent structural challenges in the sector and the difficult task ahead for the seventh administration of pursuing transformation of South Africa's science technology and Innovation sector and using STI to tackle the stubborn legacies of our Colonial and apath past honorable chairperson honorable Palo stood here to stood here and made a point that over 30 years the ANC has not been able to to do anything to transform to transform the structural challenges in the STI sect what it doesn't mention is that this is a consequence of what you call separate development the leg of separate Development Special inequality inherited from Colonial apath and in fact the ANC post 1994 has done much to vastly change the inherited STI sector to ensure that there's a greater inclusion and participation of South African working class particularly Africans and blacks in general to address this challenge that honorable pal was raised flowing from the ANC resolutions this is why we welcome the approval by the cabinet of a comprehensive implementation plan for the 2019 white paper on science technology and Innovation the white paper commits itself to redressing the the imbalances of the past by funding Grassroots Innovations our view is that this will allow greater participation of communities and ensure Innovations are not the exclusive Preserve of the elite groups found in the appen centers but they are also serving workingclass communities found in the rural and Township communities which were otherwise excluded in the past the white paper also commits itself to using public procurement to further Innovation and Technology localization a country and a people that is in the catchup of development and technological upgrading should preoccupy itself with a competitiveness of local firms against their Global counterparts honorable chers the the development of local Industries and their competitiveness cannot be left to chance or Miracle it should be a deliberate and consisted effort to fund research and development to increase the productive capacity of our economy now at the center of this intervention is to ensure the sustainability of new and transformed broad broad-based black economic empowerment firms in or outside the existing Supply chains of s soes as well as to expand the Competitive Edge of smmes in our economy also of key strategic importance in the white paper is the decadal plan which is a 10-year plan that seeks to enhance National governance and coordination through new structures such as the presidential plenary and dedicated interministerial committee honorable members the Mandate of the Department of Science and Innovation amongst other things is to play a coordinating and steering role of STI across all sectors and tires of government this place is the Department of the Strategic exis of technological development and driving economic growth but for this to happen DSi must be embedded in the core Economic and Development policy sectors of government it must Forge strategic alliances with the key Economic Department such as dtic agriculture Health forestry fisheries and environment minerals and petroleum and electricity and energy to to drive critical Innovation the state needs to play an active role through investment in research and development of new technologies to drive the industrialization of our economy and beneficiation in all advanced economies of the world the state has been Central in investing in developing new technologies for instance there would be no internet computer or GPS if the American state did not invest billions into the research work of Defense Advanced research projects our view is that there should be a relationship between Innovation and growth policy and vice versa crucially DSi must work hand in glove with provincial and local governments to build a Grassroots Innovation System rooted in local community to emphasize this point a development Economist hun Shang argues that it is important for de for developing countries to invest in research and development and acquire technological capabilities to move up the value chain and compete globally he further argues that technology transfer and domestic Innovation should be prioritized over simply relying on imported Technologies this means that the state must be at the Forefront or at the center of investing in Innovation the government must be willing to take take the ultimate risks and incentivize innovators the centrality of the state in building Innovative capacity can never be overstated it is against this backdrop that we strongly disagree with the budget cards in the department of science technology and Innovation we of the view that it not only limits the capacity of the department to do its work but it is counterproductive to the whole economy and government our view is that the department of Science and Innovation is Central in our quest to reindustrialize our economy there must therefore be a strong link between our industrial strategy and the work of the department to underscore this point president khma on the occasion of the science technology and Innovation Summit held in 2013 remarked and I quote in any case no modern society has scaled their heights of social progress without Science and Technology as the innately driving impulse as amply demonstrated elsewhere in the world Science and Technology are a precondition for modernization it even enables society's privileg previously stuck in the underdevelopment to catch up with if not Le frog those already determining the development agenda I close good if the Science and Technology if Science and Technology are a precondition to development as president khma suggests this means that more money should be allocated to the department to accelerate the process of addressing the persistent challenges associated with underdevelopment such as structural unemployment inequality and poverty in conclusion the department of STI must also help our country build State capacity to deliver our services more effectively and efficiently to address spatial inequality honorable chair we also need to have a broader discussion about the legislative framework of patents and intellectual property to break the monopolies and ensure the public can benefit from them this is consistent with the proposal of the white paper to ensure that the legislation intellectual property rights from publicly financed research and development responds to the changing policy context my considered view is that strong protection of iprs May encourage monopolies hinder research and development and inhibit the interest of society the private sector cannot continue to be the major beneficiaries of State funed innovation without any returns and this is what Minister the Italian development Economist mazuk calls socializing the risk and privatizing the rewards we need to find mechanisms to ensure that Society benefits from State funed Innovations um I thank you thank you very much for your time P thank you very much I will now be calling The Honorable the minister of science technology and Innovation thank you you know MK I would like to teach you science you you never go to court to go and decree about a concept a concept like the G if you don't like it you win it in debate and engagement you can't go to cour you don't that's totally totally totally unscientific we must teach you science you can't go and decree in a court of law that a concept can be used now at least we all agreed uh chairperson uh that we need more money for this department all agreed that's one thing you should be supporting it so that we can fight for more money I want to say to honorable minatu I would have thought that what in terms of what you argued would have supported the budget because most of the things we are talking about are things that we are doing I couldn't outline all of them because of time but our health Innovation portfolio is massive it's huge whether it's on HIV AIDS the latest now we just launched a Nuclear Medicine facility to facilitate the treatment of cancer Diagnostics as well as Therapeutics it's lots of things that we are actually doing on health Innovation covid-19 World Health Organization said South Africa was amongst the best in terms of mobilizing social science to deal with covid-19 attitudes and so on similarly we have a huge portfolio of indigenous knowledge system because we we we are the most biod we in the top five in the world in terms of the most biodiverse country we have only studied in fact I'm told no more than 10% of the plants species that we have in our country we have lots of things working with our her is very important because we will end up discovering new things we are also got we also have a very close working relationship with the Chinese because Chinese are very good in terms of traditional Chinese medicines so we actually do all those things together honorable M I agree with you when you say your emphasis on digital technologies that is very important and we are still going to be able to share with you some of the things that we are we are also doing bambo you argue so well about what science is you should be supporting this budget but because the eff is caught in this opposition ISM everything that government comes with you must oppose it I don't understand why you don't support what you are supporting because let me concede let me concede you do have understanding of of science but then when you come to the conclusion then you mess it up turn it upside down yes just Mr honorable Minister may you please take a seat as we is this a point of order no thank you very much CH person I think look the is it a point of order yes I'm raising a chair person thank you yeah are you the chair person chair um I think the the minister if he is agreed and he stands on what he saying now which which rule which rule chair yeah section which rule which rule chair which which rule are you Rising Ru yeah check it can you protect please complete your point I mean honorable member it is not possible that we must support a budget that is not enough to us not a of it's not a point of order please it's not a point of order you can only detect that it's a point of order when I'm finished okay continue I'm asking you finish your point not a monologue yes chair as we raised it in the committee we're raising it again now the austerity measures that are put on this department are affecting the department from okay it's not a point of there's no way I ask you to from talking you're not going to achieve it thank you honorable member honorable Minister will you continue with your speech please thank you uh honorable chair and and honorable members let me agree with the honorable post honorable member um honorable Minister will you please take your kindly take your seat um could you please speak on the point of order thank you chair I don't want the minister to mislead the house he can't say he doesn't understand why the eff is rejecting when we went there and you explained the reasons why we are rejecting this budget so he must not mislead the house he must rather because he's closing the debate is this a point of I don't think another point of order Minister please continue Minister the point of order chair and you're the only chair in this house you have never asked for assistance from anyone especially the ones of the gnu they must keep quiet they must focus on their government of thank you very much us alone thank you honorable Minister please continue h let me agree with honorable bosov that precisely because the results of science are not immediately available then we tend to underfund it I think that's a very important issue that we need to take up as we seek more funding honorable L I want to say to you our focus on health Innovation is a very holistic one we are acutely aware and there's a strong focus on communicable diseases including obesity and also the role of humanities in actually understanding this so we are your points that we are making are some of the things that we are actually doing thank you very much thank you very much that thank you thank you can I have order please order thank you we not finished with that concludes the debate and The Business of the mini this minary session the minary will now rise thank you yeah chairman you going to make us redundant that pumble e e e
